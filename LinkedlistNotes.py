## Linked list notes (single and double linked)

## Singlly linked list have only 1 connection between nodes

## last item in list is None/Null

## class create objects, creating the node

## node.next= ref to a diff object

## dont have indexes

## add, lookup, delete, and access a node are all O(n)

## removing and adding sum at the beginning is O(1)

## For doubly linked lists, they have pointers for both regular and inverse direction
# They will have node.val, node.next, node.prev
